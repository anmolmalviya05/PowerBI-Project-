ðŸ“¢ Excited to share my latest Power BI resume dashboard! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

Hey community! I wanted to showcase my Power BI skills by creating a visually appealing and interactive resume dashboard. ðŸš€

ðŸ”Ž This resume dashboard is packed with key information about my professional experience, skills, and education. With the help of Power BI and DAX functions, I was able to bring my resume to life!

Here are some highlights of what I've achieved in this project:

ðŸ“Œ Created Various Visuals: I utilized the power of Power BI to create stunning visuals like pie charts, Stacked bar charts, and tables. These visuals make it easier for recruiters and hiring managers to quickly grasp my qualifications and skills.

ðŸ“Œ Leveraged DAX Functions: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) played a crucial role in shaping the functionality of my resume dashboard. By using DAX functions like calculate,min,max, All e.t.c. , I created measures, which is later used in cards and text box for current role and other things like current company, its description and period.

ðŸ“Œ Implemented Bookmarks, Tooltip and Buttons: To enhance the user experience, I incorporated tooltips and buttons in the dashboard. Tooltips provide additional context and information when users hover over specific data points, offering deeper insights into my achievements and skills. Buttons, on the other hand, enable users to navigate through different sections of my resume with ease.

ðŸ’¼ The resume dashboard is a testament to my proficiency in Power BI, data visualization, and DAX. It not only showcases my technical skills but also demonstrates my ability to present information in a clear and engaging manner.
